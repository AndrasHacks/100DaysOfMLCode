# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : March 1 , 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : I have started to read again the [Machine Learning for Humans](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12) articles, and started to get a grasp of linear regression. I understand the very basic math of having a single feature and figuring out the learnign algorithm.

**Thoughts** : Tomorro I need to get into coding mode and implement some learning algorithms what I researched today.

**Tasks for the upcomming days** :
 - Implement linear regression for a single feature in Python
 - Implement linear regression for three freatures in Python
 - Implement gradient descent
 - Play with the Boston Housing dataset
 - Dig deeper in the math with the 'An Introduction into Statistical Learning'
